    <p>
      We here at Rate Dogs take the job of rating dogs seriously. VERY
      seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      We've rated dogs from here to Timbuktu and let me tell you, we've given
      them all a fair shake (especially if they know shake).

      Our new website is poised to be the premier location for Dogs and Dog
      Ratings across the northern seaboard, let me tell you what.
